Memory Integration LlamaIndex

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines are improving how AI systems interact with custom data, but two critical components we will focus on here: memory and hybrid search. In this article, we will explore how integrating these powerful features can transform your RAG system from a simple question-answering tool into a context-aware, intelligent conversational agent.

Memory in RAG allows your system to maintain and leverage conversation history, creating more coherent and contextually relevant interactions. Meanwhile, hybrid search combines the semantic understanding of vector search with the precision of keyword-based approaches, significantly enhancing the retrieval accuracy of your RAG pipeline.

In this article, we will be using LlamaIndex to implement both memory and hybrid search using Qdrant as the vector store and Googleâ€™s Gemini as our Large Language model.
